This project is a comprehensive exercise designed to consolidate back-end development concepts learned during this trimester. By building a simple file management platform, we integrate key technologies such as Node.js, MongoDB, and Redis, while applying essential features like authentication, pagination, and background processing. The platform provides users with the ability to securely upload, view, and manage files, including functionalities like changing file permissions and generating image thumbnails.

The platform supports core functionalities essential for a modern file management service. Users can authenticate via tokens, ensuring secure access to their files. Key features include listing all files, uploading new ones, modifying file permissions, and viewing stored files. For image files, the platform automatically generates thumbnails to enhance usability. Background tasks, efficient pagination, and robust error handling are incorporated for scalability and smooth user experience.

The project follows a modular design, encouraging best practices like splitting the code into reusable components and utilities stored in a utils folder. This approach ensures flexibility and maintainability. MongoDB is used for data storage, while Redis facilitates caching and background task management. The implementation is guided step-by-step, offering structured learning opportunities while allowing creative freedom in organizing and structuring the codebase. This project mirrors real-world scenarios, offering hands-on experience in assembling a fully functional back-end product.
